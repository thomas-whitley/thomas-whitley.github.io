title: Developer extraordinaire at work...
---

This is a "hello world" post - not the first of its kind, but the first from a developer of this kind, you might say.  This blog's primary purpose is to trace progress as I trek a somewhat circuitous path through web development course material and related background material.  This journey will naturally include any mathematical analysis and proofs as needed for supporting the 'science' in the larger scope of computer science.  It aint just code monkeying - no, part of the experience will be wrangling with performance considerations of machines and the platforms that run on them, and - oh yeah - algorithms.  (more to follow...)

(In case the above intro has alarmed you, just breathe for a moment and focus on this relaxing cat gif below):

That's all, folks!  (for now)
